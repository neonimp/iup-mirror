<p>IupVisualLED, or simply VLed, is an integrated development environment to 
edit and test LED files. It is inspired by some popular visual interface 
editors, but it has its own characteristics and features. </p>
<p>Historically the VLed name came from a master dissertation written by Raquel 
Prates back in 1994:</p>
<pre>Oliveira Prates, R.; Gattass, M. ;and Figueiredo, L. H. 
&quot;Visual LED: uma ferramenta interativa para geração de interfaces gráficas&quot;
M.Sc. dissertation, Computer Science Department, PUC-Rio, 1994.
[<a href="../download/prates94.pdf">prates94.pdf</a><span>&nbsp;</span>in Portuguese]</pre>
<p>T<span class="auto-style2">he new VLed has the essence of that work and 
evolve it with the objective of providing a complete environment for editing and 
testing LED files. </span></p>
<p>When a LED file is automatically loaded and its elements are created and 
displayed at the tree bellow. The elements in the tree are listed in the same 
order they are declared in the code. Some elements in the hierarchy tree are 
links to the element itself, a double click will select the actual element. A 
double click in the element will select it in the code. The automatic load can 
be disabled and the load or unload can be done manually in the LED menu.</p>
